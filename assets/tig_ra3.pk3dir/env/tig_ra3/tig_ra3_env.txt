The Mistyvalley and Overcast env maps used in tig_ra3 where
developed and designed by Mandog (mandog@ebom.org) and are free
to use. I request that you do **NOT** use the same folder 
structure however. So copy the images to your own /env/yourmap/ 
folder. This will stop any conflicts between levels.

Mandog would also love to hear from you if you used her textures. 
Just send an email to mandog@ebom.org

Thanx!
