info

About 6 months in development working on it between 
..::LvL updates. The Clan Arena is targeted at small
matches between 2 and 8 people. The other arenas a 
good for 1on1 and 2on2 games

====================================================
construction

base:           none.
editors:        Q3Radiant and GtkRadinat
                 http://www.qeradiant.com/

other progs:    Q3 Build by
                 Sagnor <sagnor@endorproductions.com>

                PakScape v0.11 by Peter Engstrom 

                Also Notepad and Photoshop

know bugs:      'Succulent Subversion' can be a little 
                 slow due to the fog, most people should 
                 not have any problems however.

                'Flat Ground' can be a little slow on 
                 some low end set-ups. The reason is the 
                 lightmap is so big :[

                The out side curves on 'Stolen Goods' 
                 have 'gaps' on the medium curve 
                 setting. This is more of a Q3A 
                 bug/feature than a mapping error. 

                A door/button sound is heard when you 
                 shoot the *gong* on 'Quiet Times'. 
                 There is no 'silent' shootable triggers 
                 at all in Q3A, so this was the best I 
                 could come up with. Not really a bug 
                 more like a limitation of Q3A entities

build time:     between work and LvL updates over the 
                 last 6 months

compile:        see tig_ra3_compile.txt for info and 
                 notes.
