# baseq3a

Unofficial Quake III Arena gamecode patch

# What is done:

 * new toolchain used (optimized q3lcc and q3asm)
 * upstream security fixes
 * floatfix
 * fixed vote system
 * fixed spawn system
 * fixed in-game crosshair proportions
 * fixed UI mouse sensitivity for high-resolution
 * fixed server browser + faster scanning
 * new demo UI (subfolders,filtering,sorting)
 * updated serverinfo UI
 * map rotation system
 * unlagged weapons
 * improved prediction
 * damage-based hitsounds
 * colored skins
 * high-quality proportional font renderer
 * single-line cvar declaration, improved cvar code readability and development efficiency

# TODO:

 * bugfixes
 * add shrinking and growing effects through a limited number of red and blue pill commands
 * ant-man style shrinking where the player doesn't get slower as they get smaller, larger players move slower because of larger metabolisms
 * king of the hill with portals. instead of rounds, levels run continuously, each time a player makes it to first place or hits the score limit, only they are teleported to the next map and the other players remain, the game is won by rotating through all the maps hitting the score limit in each one. kings can move because worlds using interdimensional portals, non-kings get blended.
 * DONE: many many weapons from every other mod, need a handy way to do this with data
 * walking on walls. possible way to implement, load the world in 6 orientations along each axis, then estimate the intersections of each corner
 * puzzles like the one in myst to solve, add EngineOfCreation


## TODO

  * Real auto-sprite for models using portal code but put in renderer and apply with RF_* name. 
  * Use srand() or seeded-random for random looking but synchronized effects.
  * Add radius damage to lighting bolt only in the rain.
  * Add atmospheric effects, smoke and sparks over lava, dust, worldly fog, to old maps.
  * Multiworld camera features
  * Add stray rounds to projectiles
  * Finish portal interpolation, and seeing one portal surface through another portal, projectiles (distance from origin). Share entities between multiple server qagame QVMs, possibly through the engine itself or a new API call for game/g_*.c
  * Finish multiworld TODOs like not crashing after 10 maps and cvars. 
  * Rocket Arena maps. Place white return teleporters for arena 0 on player_start positions and going through a portal counts as a vote to white arena to play in. Or use drop command to drop portal connects and in RA mode return to arena 0. Always spawn in arena 0 during intermission until voted, or remove guns from arena 0 and repawn in voted arena.
  * Add autosprite flag to misc_model for rotating like portal always facing camera
  * Shoot portal gun twice in the same place to fill a specific area of space on the wall for the portal, generating a new portal model to fit the surface. The portal stretches to cover an entire wall. 3 kinds of portals. Shoot again and the portal goes back to small and round. Maximize at an optional 50 x 50 = 2500 area. Somehow visualize morphing from sphere to whole wall. Need to learn how to make meshes.
  * Use geometric content from previous campaigns Q1, Q2, but ruin the ability to speed run (smarter bots, more enemies, team based, disrupting events and puzzles, long missions like Q2 Ground Zero Research Hangar) then create a new mode called shortcuts, where alternate puzzles can be solved to jump through maps quickly.
  * Free standing portals should use gravity for like half a second, to land on the ground correctly, then figure out where the bounding box puts it and maybe add a stand.
  * Make a Doom style Prawler amygdala that you have to kill for in a boss fight to get teleportation abilities.
  * Temporal goggles to see where other players portals are created. Add temporal paths using botlib to show a stream like donny darko where portals lead. Other worlds lead out into space somewhere. Also show the rendering between portals should stretch the world around for a second.
  * Fix portals on walls, possibly using bounce for half a second? Then check for a flat/even surface on at least 4 corners, if it is not on the same plane show the little "portal failure" bubbles where the explosion would have been. At least player movement must be able to handle points, how is it possible to detect holes and other geometry? Disregard irregular vertices completely and hide every vertex within a 100u radius by moving them to 10000 * AngleVectors() to hide an protrusions. Holes will just get covered up or the portal would go through it.
  * Reportedly, Portal the game it is a developer responsibility to specify where portals can be placed, this seems incredibly difficult to me or it was much more linear than I thought (i.e. only one way to solve the puzzle). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNKntZzwnAw
  * Portal has view-axis ROLL turning towards the pull of gravity. Splitgate uses roll, but it is much faster than Portal 1.
  * Add Splitgate style if you go through someone else's portal it is black and unknown, might make for good traps, HAHA!
  * Trigger earthquake from kamikaze.
  * Optional for portals to be for 1 individual player, or any player can go through any players portal. NODRAW and SINGLECLIENT flags to be set.
  * Add auto-regen health shield thing?
  * Fix portal gun.  Use teleporter location to draw entities in relative locations on the other side of the jump.  Use a special flag on teleport to tell it where to interpolate for other players even though EF_TELEPORT_BIT is used, just follow velocity backwards one frame on personal teleporters. Looking through a standing portal has a weird repetitive effect because of depth write or sorting or something. Turn off depth in shader or skip entity in tr_main.c? Measure/cache midpoint of portal model and use on floor and wall alignment. Fix corners by tracing in server for edges. Add NOPORTAL surfaceParm. Still take falling damage for landing on a portal. Projectiles through portals. Face wall portals like 5 degrees towards player away from original angle. No falling damage while holding the portal gun.
  * Teach bots to use portals.
  * Add features to support other map types like Xonotic (warp zones are just automatically centered cameras with some fancy distortion shaders, Quake 1 did not normally have the camera feature) and QueToo (map format?) and Smokin' Guns probably added a surface parm.
  * Add tracer rounds, ammo clip sized packs for reloading, etc.
  * Infinite haste, how is this different than g_speed? Applies to only one player.
  * Boots that can climb steep slopes. 
  * Jump velocity as a part of anti-gravity boots. 
  * Power-ups cover entire body or just the gun setting from server and client setting. 
  * Add player state to UI QVM so multiple cursors can be shared, and players can see map and game configuration.
  * Add walk on walls, better movement than Trem.
  * Live-action minimap, using procedurally generated mini maps, draw small players top-down and glowing like quad damage.
  * Ricochet mode where damage only applies after projectile bounces/splash damage
  * Showing enemy health and armor above their head like an RPG
  * Extra UI menus with multiQVM, for voting on maps and bitcoin setup, Instant replay, consolidate all VM UIs scoreboard/postgame/HUD/menus in to 1 UI system, replace the menu address with an API call.
  * Many mod support, compiling and playing lots of different game types, capture the flag with 3+ teams
  * Campaign mode, playing older engine content and playing as enemy characters, new AI for old enemies
  * Keep away, where one team has to kill the flag carrier and return the flag to score.
  * Add light coming from player to flashlight command so even if you're pointing at the sky it looks like a flashlight is on.
  * Make "tech-demo" as an example of some game dynamic. Make a Matrix mod that loads the white loading program and jump simulation and UrT subway. Make a space to planet landing sequence with death modes. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqXFF8mlEU
  * Quake 5 play on the home-worlds of each species, but in a mistakenly massive defeat of stop the Arenas on Vadrigas, they've expanded to each home world.
  * 2001 Space Odyssey to meet VEGA aka HAL aka SKYNET
  * Playing split screen across the network for team based games where you might've been playing next to each other so you can watch your teammate.
  * automatically generate the rest of team assets like colors players using dynamic skins
  * LookAtKiller and LookAheadOf for aimbot powerup
  * Add spawn point as a target for homing missiles if there are no other players, add homing plasma, homing bullets, homing bfg, etc
  * TODO: zombies can't be killed again, immortal, but also walk very slowly, half speed
  * TODO: in the spirit of lame bot code, all the cyborgs should get depth hack powerup after their stamina recharges
  * TODO: add stamina that forces the player to walk instead of run, and double stamina, or double the charge time they get a special class based powerup to use, "HOLDABLE_GIVE"ETC
  * TODO: make multiplayer monsters like the new Doom game where you can play as the monster with special powers instead of weapons.
  * TODO: add special ability powerups like Sarge can teleport in Quake Champions after waiting for a minute
